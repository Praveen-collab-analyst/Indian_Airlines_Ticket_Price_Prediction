# Indian Airlines Ticket Price Prediction

Predict airline ticket prices using machine learning and data analytics.

---

## Overview

This repository contains a complete workflow for predicting airline ticket prices using Python and machine learning. The project covers data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

---

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Summary statistics, null value checks, duplicate detection.
  - Visualizations: histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, box plots, categorical value counts.
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Dropping unnecessary columns.
  - Label encoding for categorical variables.
  - Exporting cleaned dataset for reproducibility.
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Selection of relevant features for modeling.
- **Model Development:**
  - Train/test split using scikit-learn.
  - Random Forest Regressor with hyperparameter tuning (`n_estimators=150`, `max_depth=30`, `min_samples_leaf=5`, `min_samples_split=30`).
- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), RÂ² Score.
- **Model Deployment:**
  - Model serialization with pickle for production use.
  - Example of loading and making predictions with the saved model.

## Saving and Loading the Model

> **Special Note:**  
> The trained Random Forest model (`rf-cyber.pkl`) can be very large and may exceed GitHub's upload limits.  
> **The `.pkl` file is NOT included in this repository.**  
> To use the model, you must generate and save it yourself by running the notebook.

**To save the model from your notebook:**
```python
import pickle
model = rf  # Your trained RandomForestRegressor object
file_path = 'rf-cyber.pkl'
with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
    pickle.dump(model, file)
```

**To load the model for prediction:**
```python
import pickle
file_path = 'rf-cyber.pkl'
with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
    loaded_model = pickle.load(file)
```

**Example prediction:**
```python
# Replace the values below with your feature set
loaded_model.predict([[3,2,4,2,0,5,1,2.17,1]])
```
